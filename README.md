# Project-3: comPOST

## Description

The purpose of this application is to connect people who cannot compost their organic waste with people who can and in-turn connect people with excess amounts of composted soil or organic product with people who have use for it. The application is built as social media with a user rating system based on positive or negative experiences of other users. This application is still in itâ€™s infancy and continues to receive updates and improvements.
